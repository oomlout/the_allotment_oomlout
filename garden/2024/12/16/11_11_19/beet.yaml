beet: I love the filament that @3dqf produces in Leigh! However the large inner diameter
  of their spools isn't considered in the design of a lot of spool holders. I'm pointing
  the finger at you spool holder designer of the Bambu A1 Mini! The solution for me
  was an inner sleeve. ( https://github.com/oomlout/oomlout_three_d_printer_printer_bambu_lab_a1_mini_reel_holder_experiment
  ) But it was a true goldilocks journey! A spacer to give the spool more room? It
  stopped the binding but the reel would be pulled off and fall on the floor. Making
  the spool holder diameter bigger? Meant spools with smaller inner diameters no longer
  fit. Fitting an inner sleeve? Just right!
